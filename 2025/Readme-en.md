# Preferred Networks Internship 2025 Selection Tasks

Thank you for your application to the Preferred Networks internship.

The selection tasks consist of the following two types of tasks:

- "Coding task" to assess general coding skills.
- "Thematic tasks" to assess understanding of specialized knowledge related to the internship theme.

Both for the coding task and the thematic tasks, the content of the tasks varies depending on the theme. Instructions for each theme are provided on the following pages of this document. Please follow the instructions for your **first choice theme** and submit your answers.

## How to Submit

The submission methods differ for the coding task and the thematic tasks. The deadline for both is **23:59 (JST) on Tuesday, May 6, 2025**. Please submit your work with ample time to spare.

### Coding Task

Please take the coding task via the external service (omitted). This URL is identical to the one provided in the tasks for each theme.
(URL omitted)

When taking the coding task on Track, **please use the same email address as the one you used when applying.** Using a different email address may result in your coding task submission being considered invalid in subsequent selection processes.

The link for the coding task is intended for use by the test-taker only. Sharing it with third parties or publishing it on the internet is strictly prohibited. Please manage the test link responsibly.

### Thematic Tasks

Please submit your thematic tasks using this form (URL omitted).

In past years, there have been cases where submitted files were empty, making it impossible to proceed with the selection process. Please double-check that you have created and saved your submissions in the specified manner before submitting.

In addition to submitting your thematic tasks, you will also be asked to choose your preferred internship theme on this form. Please check the detailed instructions that were separately sent to you in an email.

## Important Notes

Please apply only if you agree to the following precautions. Applying will be considered as your acceptance of the following precautions.

### Prohibition of Sharing Selection Tasks

To maintain fairness in the selection process, publishing, sharing, or discussing the contents of the selection tasks with others, including other applicants, is prohibited. Furthermore, it is prohibited to publicly disclose any submitted works that could reveal the selection tasks.

For example, uploading the selection tasks or your answers to a public repositories on GitHub or social media is prohibited.

If evidence of leakage is found, the applicant will be disqualified. In addition, if an applicant allows another applicant to copy their answers, both applicants will be disqualified.

Only after the selection period has ended and the tasks have been published on our website, you can publish your answers to the published tasks. However, disclosing any tasks not explicitly made public on our website, is strictly prohibited. This includes both the tasks themselves and your respective solutions.

### Restrictions on the Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

This selection aims to evaluate your coding and problem-solving abilities. Therefore, except for explicitly permitted uses and cases within specific thematic tasks, **the use of large language models (LLMs) is prohibited**. This restriction applies not only to externally communicating LLMs such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot but also to self-hosted LLMs in the applicant's local environment.

However, it is permissible to use traditional keyword searches on the web or conduct literature research to answer the questions.

### Estimated Required Time

We expect the coding task and the thematic task to take up to two days. You can submit your work even if you have not completed all tasks, so please work within a reasonable time frame that does not interfere with your coursework.

### About the Coding Task

This year's coding task consists of a total of three problems, but it is not necessary to answer all of them. For problems 2 and 3, whether an answer is required or not varies depending on the desired theme, so please check the tasks for your chosen theme.

The languages and libraries allowed may be restricted depending on the desired theme. In addition, at the bottom of the problem statement displayed on the left of the answer screen, there are notes about the external libraries and languages you can use. Please follow all instructions.

There is no penalty for running incorrect answers or saving progress during the implementation process. However, submissions can only be made once and cannot be canceled, so please be careful.

There are no time limits for any of the problems in the coding task.

The coding task is designed to comprehensively evaluate your general coding skills, knowledge of algorithms, and thinking ability. You will not be disqualified simply for not answering all problems correctly.

Selection evaluators can review all submitted answers. Even if you were unable to solve a problem or your implementation is incomplete, we recommend leaving comments in your source code explaining your intentions and what you attempted to do. If you proceed to the interview stage, you may be asked to discuss your submitted implementation and comments directly with the interviewers.

Although the system calculates a score for the task, this is just one factor in the evaluation process. The selection process will be based on a combination of the coding task answers, discussions during the interview, and other interview content. We do not want to misjudge your abilities due to unfamiliarity with the system or lack of experience with programming contest-style selections.

### Invention and Intellectual Property

Thematic tasks evaluate your understanding of the knowledge and skills involved in the internship theme. To avoid disputes over the ownership of inventions, **please do not include any patentable new ideas, such as unpublished research results or unique problem-solving ideas, in your submissions (reports, etc.)**.

### Submission Format for Thematic Tasks

If the task is in a report format, please submit the answer in an A4-sized PDF file named `survey.pdf`.
Please follow the format specified for each task regarding page limits and styles.
If no specific format is specified, the page limit is within two pages (including the reference section), and the format is free.

If the task is not in a report format, please submit the answer in the format specified in each task.
If the specified format is `zip`, please submit the file as `survey.zip`.
