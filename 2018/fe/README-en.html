<h2 id="task-description">Task description</h2>
<p>In this task, you are asked to develop a <strong>prototype</strong> of a web service for annotating seminar presentation videos together with their audio contents (metadata). Do not use any external cloud services.</p>
<p>The application can have any kind of UI as long as it satisfies the given requirements. For the rest of undefined behavior, specifications, or UI, please make a resonable choice to maximize the UX yourself.</p>
<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Please create a prototype of a web service where users can upload, view, and delete video files on the server side.</p>
<h4 id="example-for-reference">Example for reference</h4>
<p><img src="1.gif" alt="Uploading video from browser" /></p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> necessary to make a completely identical UI as the above example, as long as the requirements are satisfied.</p>
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>The implementation can assume that the number of accesses is low since this is a prototype</li>
<li>It allows at least to upload, view, and delete MP4 files
<ul>
<li>It is not specified how to internally store uploaded videos</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You are also encouraged to add improvements for better UX such as uploading by drag-and-drop, or a progress bar to show uploading status.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>
<p>On the prototype web service you implemented in Problem 1, please add a feature for annotating the uploaded video with a description of the audio contents such as spoken texts.</p>
<h4 id="example-for-reference-1">Example for reference</h4>
<p><img src="2.gif" alt="Annotation workflow" /></p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> necessary to make a completely same UI as the above example, as long as the requirements are satisfied.</p>
<h4 id="requirement">Requirement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Annotated metadata can be not only spoken text but also start and finish time (in seconds), and category information such as ordinary speech, voiced pause (e.g., &quot;Ah&quot;, &quot;You know&quot;), and noise (e.g., applause, time-keeping bell)</li>
<li>The annotation information is stored on the server side</li>
<li>The annotation information can be downloaded in the following JSON format

</ul>
<p>You are also encouraged to add improvements for better UX such as using SPA (Single Page Application), also for the video upload feature in Problem 1.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-optional">Problem 3 (Optional)</h3>
<p>Let's assume that the UX of the annotation features you implemented in Problem 1 and 2 is still not sufficient.</p>
<p>There can be additional improvements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing fast-forward and frame-by-frame playback for easier annotation</li>
<li>Visualizing the waveform of the audio for easier detection of the beginning and end of speech</li>
<li>Highlighting the time regions that are being edited for concurrent edit by multiple annotators</li>
</ul>
<p>Your choice for improvement can be (but is not limited to) the ones listed above. Please implement at least one improvement for better UX, and explain the benefit of the improvements in the document.</p>
<p>(This is the end of instruction)</p>
