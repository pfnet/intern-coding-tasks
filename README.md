<img src="logo.png" width="500">

This repository contains coding problems used for the screening process in PFN (Preferred Networks) summer internship.

English and Japanese statements are available. The overview of the problems is as follows.

## 2021-2024
The problems in 2021-2024 consist of "coding task" and "thematic task".

## 2020
The problem in 2020 consists of "coding task" and "survey task".

## 2019
The problem set in 2019 consists of six themes. Each applicant needed to choose one of them according to the theme they have chosen.

- Machine Learning
- Back-end
- Front-end
- Chip
- Performance Optimization
- Computer Vision (Chainer)


## 2018
The problem set in 2018 consists of five themes.

- **Machine Learning/Mathematics**: You are asked to implement an algorithm of adversarial examples for some neural network model. You need to write a simple report on the performance of the algorithm as well.
- **Back-end**: You are asked to create a tool that analyzes log files.
- **Front-end**: You are asked to develop a prototype of an annotation tool for speech videos.
- **Processor/Compiler**: You are asked to optimize the code of matrix multiplication. Further, you need to design a hardware circuit of matrix multiplication.
- **Chainer**: You are asked to implement a training code for some model, using Chainer.

## 2017
The problem set in 2017 consists of four themes.

- **Machine Learning/Mathematics**: Reinforcement learning, Cartpole, Cross Entropy Method.
- **Back-end**: Implementation of 'ls' command.
- **Front-end**: Creation of search UI.
- **Chip**: Hardware circuit design.
