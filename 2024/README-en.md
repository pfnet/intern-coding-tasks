# Preferred Networks Internship 2024 Selection Tasks

Thank you for applying for the Preferred Networks internship.

These selection tasks consist of the following two tasks.

- The "coding task" that evaluates general coding skills.
- The "thematic task" that evaluates the understanding of expert knowledge related to the internship theme.

Both for the coding task and the thematic task, the content of the tasks varies depending on the theme. Instructions for each theme are written on the pages following this file. Please follow the instructions for **the theme of your first choice** and submit your answers accordingly.

## How to submit

The submission methods vary for the coding tasks and thematic tasks.
For both, the due date is **Monday, May 6, 2024, 23:59 Japan Standard Time**.
Please submit your work well in advance of the deadline.

### Coding Task

Please take the coding test at the following URL and submit it on the same system. This URL is identical to the one listed in each theme's task PDF.
(omit URL)

### Thematic Task

Please submit the theme-specific assignments through this google form (omit URL).

In past years, there have been cases where the selection process could not proceed because the submitted files were empty. Please check again at the time of submission that you have created and saved your submission in the specified manner.

In this form, in addition to submitting theme-specific tasks, you are also asked to choose an internship theme. Please check the detailed instructions that were separately sent to you in an email.

## Notice

Please apply only if you agree to the following notices. If you apply, it will be assumed that you have accepted these notices.

### Prohibition of Task Sharing

To maintain fairness in the selection process, publishing, sharing, or discussing the contents of the screening assignment with others, including other applicants, is prohibited.

If evidence of leakage is found, the applicant will be disqualified. In addition, if one applicant allows another applicant to copy their answers, both applicants will be disqualified.

- For example, publishing the tasks or your answers to public repositories on GitHub or social networking sites are prohibited.
- Using large language model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT and Copilot for the completion of selection tasks is considered an act of sharing the contents of the tasks and prohibited as a basic principle.
  - However, this does not apply if the use is explicitly permitted in the problem statements of coding tasks or thematic tasks.
  - In particular, as discussed later, the use of services like ChatGPT or Copilot is allowed in Problem 3 of the coding tasks. Please note that the special approval for the use of LLM services does not mean that sharing or leakage of the selection tasks is allowed. Such acts are still prohibited.
- There is no problem with using traditional keyword searches for web searches or literature reviews to answer the questions.

You can publish your answers to the published problems only after the selection period has ended and the problems have been published on our website. Disclosing any tasks provided on Track, or any other tasks not explicitly made public on our website, is strictly prohibited. This includes both the tasks themselves and your respective solutions.


### Expected Time

We expect the coding task and the thematic task to take up to two days. You can submit your completed work without solving all of the problems. Please do your best without neglecting your coursework.

### About the Coding Task

The coding assignment for this year consists of six problems in total. However, you are not required to answer all of them. For problems 3 and beyond, whether an answer is required or not varies depending on the desired course; please check the assignment for your chosen course.

Depending on the desired course, there may be restrictions on the programming language and libraries you can use. In addition, at the bottom of the problem statement displayed on the left of the answer screen, there are notes about the external libraries and languages you can use; please follow all instructions.

There is no penalty for running an incorrect answer or saving your progress during the implementation process. But please note that you can only submit once and you cannot withdraw your submission, so please be careful.

Problem 2 is a quiz that tests your knowledge of software. As mentioned above, you're free to use web searches or literature surveys to answer.

For Problem 3, exceptional agreement is given to use services that implement Language Model technologies such as Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.

There's no time limit for problems 1 to 5. Problem 6 has a set time limit.

The coding task is designed to comprehensively evaluate your general coding skills, knowledge of algorithms, and thinking skills.

It does not mean you must answer all the questions correctly to be hired. Rather, we encourage you to leave comments on what you intend to do in the challenge, even if you cannot solve it completely.

The interviewer will be able to review all submitted answers. Even if your answers are incomplete, we recommend commenting on them. If you proceed to the interview, you may be asked to discuss your submitted implementation and comments directly with the person in charge.

Due to the nature of the system, exam scores will be calculated. Still, they are just a factor in the decision-making process. The selection process will be based on a combination of the answers to the coding task, the discussion during the interview, and other interview details.

We do not want to be unable to see your abilities properly because you are not familiar with the system or with the programming contest-style selection process.


### Invention & Intellectual Property

The thematic assignment will assess your understanding of the knowledge and techniques involved in the internship theme.
When answering the thematic assignment questions, **it is important that you do not include any patentable ideas such as unpublished research results or original problem-solving ideas in your submission (such as a report)** in order to avoid conflicts regarding the attribution of inventions.

### Submission Instructions for Thematic Tasks

If the task is in a report format, please submit the answer in an A4 PDF with the file name `survey.pdf`.
Please follow the format specified in each question regarding page limits and format.
Unless otherwise specified, the number of pages is assumed to be no more than two including the reference section, and the format is assumed to be free.

If the task is not in a report format, please submit the answer following the format specified in each question.
If the specified format is `zip`, please submit the answer with the file name `survey.zip`.
